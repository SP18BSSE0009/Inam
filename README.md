This repository contains 2 java files-RabinKarp.java, TestR_K.java for Rabin Karp Algorithm
The Rabin-Karp-Algorithm
The Rabin-Karp string matching algorithm calculates a hash value for the pattern, as well as for each M-character subsequences of text to be compared. If the hash values are unequal, the algorithm will determine the hash value for next M-character sequence. If the hash values are equal, the algorithm will analyze the pattern and the M-character sequence. In this way, there is only one comparison per text subsequence, and character matching is only required when the hash values match.
